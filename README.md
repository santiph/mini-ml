# mini-ml App

This is a test project for Mercadolibre

## Installation
Node and npm are required to install the project and its dependencies.
After cloned or downloaded, run `npm install` followed by `bower install`

## Run project & Development server
Once all dependencies are installed, use gulp to run the project: `gulp`.
A web browser should be opened at `http://localhost:4000` (if not, it can be manually opened)

Any change to existing source files will be automatically reflected in the browser.
New files might require manual restart (run `rs` in the console, or finish the `gulp` process and start it again).
